		<p>his touch-screen based home automation project explains how the automation can be implemented to our homes at lower costs. In this system, a microcontroller is attached to the light loads to control them. At the controlling side, a touch screen allows any user to send the command signals to operate the loads. These signals are transferred to the microcontroller, and according to the program written, it sends the command signals to the encoder circuit. An encoder converts this data into binary format, and then transfers that to an RF transmitter; from there the data is transmitted to the receiver section.

At the receiver side, the RF receiver receives the information sent by the transmitter section, and then decodes and transfers that to the microcontroller. Therefore, the microcontroller sends the command signals to an optoisolator, which triggers the TRAICs. All the light loads are controlled by the TRIACs; as switches, these are enabled only after triggering their gates.<a href="https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/51.jpg">img</a></p>
